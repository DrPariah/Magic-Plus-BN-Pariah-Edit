# Magic-Plus-BN-Pariah-Edit

This is a BN conversion for the very old and basically untouched mod Magic-Plus. If you like it, go star the original repository please. (https://github.com/Alasnuyo/Magic-Plus) I didn't do much in the way of changes,
other than tried to update the explosions to not generate errors (successful, but I don't know how to make them effective).
This mod was built off of Arcana, looks to be pre-Magiclysm days, and the contents can be somewhat all over the place. There's a new skill involved and the ability to get full Essence
just by meditating(!), which could break the balance of Arcana something fierce. There's also some talismans (not too imbalanced), and some coherent Essence equipment (like a 
D&D style psychoactive skin for armor) along with Essence Bullets - coherent charges of shaped Essence that need no gun.
Few Issues:
- Balance, like I said, is...all over the place. There's Essence Attribute boosters that can get INSANE levels of stats. We're talking punch-out-a-Hulk levels.
- Essence Artillery Shells (name is scarier than they are, they're more like grenades or RPGs) are kinda screwed up. I don't know how to fix their explosions properly. Plasma field looks cool but doesn't do much.
- There are two Essence-based Martial Arts here. The Crimson Wind doesn't seem to have much effect. The Art of Breathing is AWESOME fun (it gives you knockback attacks!), but can get broken if you've got high stats (as it gives you passive defenses based on your stats).

Otherwise, have fun. It's a cool little mod, and if someone could polish it there'd be a lot of potential here.
